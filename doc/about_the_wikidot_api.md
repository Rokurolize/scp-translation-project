# Wikidot API

We would like to introduce a new feature for Wikidot users: **Wikidot API**.

## Basic Concept

Wikidot API is a way computer programs and automated system can access and interact with Wikidot on behalf of users. Users must "authorize" applications to use their identity by supplying them their unique key Wikidot generates for them.

## Technical Details

Wikidot API is technically an [XML-RPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC) service, with endpoint being this URL:

[https://www.wikidot.com/xml-rpc-api.php](https://www.wikidot.com/xml-rpc-api.php)

You must use HTTP Basic Authorization with the following credentials:

- user: the name of application that connects to API
- password: the unique API key of a user

## API Key and Authentication

API keys are unique and secure strings that:

1. uniquely identify a user
2. authenticate a user

If an application uses a user's key, it can act on behalf of the user and have access to sites, pages and eventually all user data.

It is important to share the key only with trust-worthy application, and never share the key publicly. This would be the same as giving someone username and password.

Users may find their API keys at *My Account* » *Settings* » *API access*.

Users can also re-generate the key.

## On Using XML-RPC Service

To use XML-RPC service, you need to have XML-RPC client that is usually a library for a programming language. The language needs to support secure SSL connections too.

We will now show how to use Wikidot API with Python (installing Python is out of scope of this document). Using XML-RPC in other languages is very similar and you can get the idea how RPC works by looking at the code below.

Run Python interactive console:

```
$ python
Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Oct  5 2008, 19:29:17)
[GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

You need to import the XML-RPC library for Python (in most cases it is already installed with the default installation of Python):

```
>>> from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy
```

Supply the URL, user (application name) and password (your API key) and construct a server object proxy and list all methods, that API provides:

```
>>> s = ServerProxy('https://your-app-name:your-key@www.wikidot.com/xml-rpc-api.php')
>>> s.system.listMethods()
```

You should get a list like this:

```
['system.listMethods', 'system.methodHelp', 'system.methodSignature', 'system.multicall', 'categories.select', 'tags.select', 'pages.select', 'pages.get_meta', 'pages.get_one', 'pages.save_one', 'files.select', 'files.get_meta', 'files.get_one', 'files.save_one', 'users.get_me', 'posts.select', 'posts.get']
```

## Explore the API Methods

The main concept of naming is as follows:

- namespace is type of object you work with
- select methods return array of names
- get methods return array of all data of matched objects
- get_one methods return array of all data of one matched object

The list will grow as the methods are added. The methods are discussed [here](http://developer.wikidot.com/forum/t-257156).

XML-RPC api is limited to 240 req/min (per user).

### categories.select

Select all categories from given site

- argument keys:

    - **site**: site to get pages from, e.g. "my-site"

    - **page**: what page (full name) we ask about

    - **files**: name of files to get meta data of — max 10 of them

We only want to make API for comments currently, but it will be expanded to both comments and forum. That's why the namespace is posts and not comments.

**Note the API for posts namespace is not yet stable. This means it may change in the future without notice and break compatibility.**
